Logstash is an open source data collection engine with real-time pipelining capabilities. Logstash can dynamically unify data from disparate sources and normalize the data into destinations of your choice. Cleanse and democratize all your data for diverse advanced downstream analytics and visualization use cases.

While Logstash originally drove innovation in log collection, its capabilities extend well beyond that use case. Any type of event can be enriched and transformed with a broad array of `input`, `filter`, and `output` `plugins`, with many native codecs further simplifying the ingestion process. Logstash accelerates your insights by harnessing a greater volume and variety of data.

### 样例

从标准输入采集数据，经过grok过滤处理，最后解码输出到控制台。适合用于测试验证。

logstash.conf：

```
input {
  stdin {
    type => stdin
  }
}

filter {
  grok {
    match => { "message" => "%{NUMBER:duration} %{IP:client}" }
  }
}

output {
  stdout {
    codec => rubydebug
  }
}
```



```shell
$ bin/logstash -f config/logstash-sample.conf 
ERROR StatusLogger No log4j2 configuration file found. Using default configuration: logging only errors to the console.
