[Tanzu Observability by Wavefront](https://docs.wavefront.com/index.html) is a high-performance streaming analytics platform that supports observability for metrics, counters, histograms, and traces/spans. The product is unique because it scales to very high data ingestion rates and query loads. You can collect data from many services and sources across your entire application stack, and can look at details for earlier data that were ingested earlier.
