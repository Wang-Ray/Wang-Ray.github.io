jhat命令用来查看跟JVM线程和栈相关的信息

```shell
$ jhat -h
Usage:  jhat [-stack <bool>] [-refs <bool>] [-port <port>] [-baseline <file>] [-debug <int>] [-version] [-h|-help] <file>

        -J<flag>          Pass <flag> directly to the runtime system. For
                          example, -J-mx512m to use a maximum heap size of 512MB
        -stack false:     Turn off tracking object allocation call stack.
        -refs false:      Turn off tracking of references to objects
        -port <port>:     Set the port for the HTTP server.  Defaults to 7000
        -exclude <file>:  Specify a file that lists data members that should
                          be excluded from the reachableFrom query.
        -baseline <file>: Specify a baseline object dump.  Objects in
                          both heap dumps with the same ID and same class will
                          be marked as not being "new".
        -debug <int>:     Set debug level.
                            0:  No debug output
                            1:  Debug hprof file parsing
                            2:  Debug hprof file parsing, no server
        -version          Report version number
        -h|-help          Print this help and exit
        <file>            The file to read

For a dump file that contains multiple heap dumps,
you may specify which dump in the file
by appending "#<number>" to the file name, i.e. "foo.hprof#3".

All boolean options default to "true"
```



```shell
$
```
