[Spring Mobile](https://projects.spring.io/spring-mobile/) is an extension to Spring MVC that aims to simplify the development of mobile web applications.

Spring Mobile is a framework that provides capabilities to detect the type of device making a request to your Spring web site and serve alternative views based on that device. Like all Spring projects, the real power of Spring Mobile is found in how easily it can be extended.

Features
* A Device resolver abstraction for server-side detection of mobile and tablet devices
* Site preference management that allows the user to indicate if he or she prefers a "normal", "mobile", or "tablet" experience
* A site switcher capable of switching the user to the most appropriate site, either mobile, tablet, or normal, based on his or her device and optionally indicated site preference
* Device aware view management for organizing and managing different views for specific devices
