### 构造器

```java
/**
     * Creates a new {@code ThreadPoolExecutor} with the given initial
     * parameters.
     *
     * @param corePoolSize the number of threads to keep in the pool, even
     *        if they are idle, unless {@code allowCoreThreadTimeOut} is set
     * @param maximumPoolSize the maximum number of threads to allow in the
     *        pool
     * @param keepAliveTime when the number of threads is greater than
     *        the core, this is the maximum time that excess idle threads
     *        will wait for new tasks before terminating.
     * @param unit the time unit for the {@code keepAliveTime} argument
     * @param workQueue the queue to use for holding tasks before they are
     *        executed.  This queue will hold only the {@code Runnable}
     *        tasks submitted by the {@code execute} method.
     * @param threadFactory the factory to use when the executor
     *        creates a new thread
     * @param handler the handler to use when execution is blocked
     *        because the thread bounds and queue capacities are reached
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if one of the following holds:<br>
     *         {@code corePoolSize < 0}<br>
     *         {@code keepAliveTime < 0}<br>
     *         {@code maximumPoolSize <= 0}<br>
     *         {@code maximumPoolSize < corePoolSize}
     * @throws NullPointerException if {@code workQueue}
     *         or {@code threadFactory} or {@code handler} is null
     */

                              TimeUnit unit,

### 内部类Worker

```java
    /**
     * Class Worker mainly maintains interrupt control state for
     * threads running tasks, along with other minor bookkeeping.
     * This class opportunistically extends AbstractQueuedSynchronizer
     * to simplify acquiring and releasing a lock surrounding each
     * task execution.  This protects against interrupts that are
     * intended to wake up a worker thread waiting for a task from
     * instead interrupting a task being run.  We implement a simple
     * non-reentrant mutual exclusion lock rather than use
     * ReentrantLock because we do not want worker tasks to be able to
     * reacquire the lock when they invoke pool control methods like
     * setCorePoolSize.  Additionally, to suppress interrupts until
     * the thread actually starts running tasks, we initialize lock
     * state to a negative value, and clear it upon start (in
     * runWorker).
     */
    private final class Worker
        extends AbstractQueuedSynchronizer
        implements Runnable
    {
        /**
         * This class will never be serialized, but we provide a
         * serialVersionUID to suppress a javac warning.
         */
        private static final long serialVersionUID = 6138294804551838833L;

        /** Thread this worker is running in.  Null if factory fails. */

### runWorker

```java
    /**
     * Main worker run loop.  Repeatedly gets tasks from queue and
     * executes them, while coping with a number of issues:
     *
     * 1. We may start out with an initial task, in which case we
     * don't need to get the first one. Otherwise, as long as pool is
     * running, we get tasks from getTask. If it returns null then the
     * worker exits due to changed pool state or configuration
     * parameters.  Other exits result from exception throws in
     * external code, in which case completedAbruptly holds, which
     * usually leads processWorkerExit to replace this thread.
     *
     * 2. Before running any task, the lock is acquired to prevent
     * other pool interrupts while the task is executing, and then we
     * ensure that unless pool is stopping, this thread does not have
     * its interrupt set.
     *
     * 3. Each task run is preceded by a call to beforeExecute, which
     * might throw an exception, in which case we cause thread to die
     * (breaking loop with completedAbruptly true) without processing
     * the task.
     *
     * 4. Assuming beforeExecute completes normally, we run the task,
     * gathering any of its thrown exceptions to send to afterExecute.
     * We separately handle RuntimeException, Error (both of which the
     * specs guarantee that we trap) and arbitrary Throwables.
     * Because we cannot rethrow Throwables within Runnable.run, we
     * wrap them within Errors on the way out (to the thread's
     * UncaughtExceptionHandler).  Any thrown exception also
     * conservatively causes thread to die.
     *
     * 5. After task.run completes, we call afterExecute, which may
     * also throw an exception, which will also cause thread to
     * die. According to JLS Sec 14.20, this exception is the one that
     * will be in effect even if task.run throws.
     *
     * The net effect of the exception mechanics is that afterExecute
     * and the thread's UncaughtExceptionHandler have as accurate
     * information as we can provide about any problems encountered by
     * user code.
     *
     * @param w the worker
     */
