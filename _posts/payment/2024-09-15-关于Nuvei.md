### nuvei gateway tokenizaition

Nuvei has PCI accreditation that allows us to store and manage customer card details for later use. When a customer wishes to make a payment, they can simply select one of their stored payment methods with no need to re-enter the card details.

If you want to allow a customer to save their payment details for future transactions, you must include “payment option details” (e.g. card, expiration date, CVV), along with a `userTokenId`, which identifies the customer. Nuvei stores the details and returns a `userPaymentOptionId` (UPO) identifier in the response. See the [Card-on-File](https://docs.nuvei.com/?p=2732) topic.

The next time your customer makes a payment, you do not need to collect the payment option details again. Instead, send their `userTokenId` and `userPaymentOptionId` in the payment request.

This is Nuvei Gateway (GW) tokenization. Nuvei also supports [network tokenization](https://docs.nuvei.com/?p=497121).
