[OpenResty](http://openresty.org/en/) is a full-fledged web platform that integrates the standard [Nginx](http://openresty.org/en/nginx.html) core, [LuaJIT](http://openresty.org/en/luajit.html), many carefully written Lua libraries, lots of high quality [3rd-party Nginx modules](http://openresty.org/en/components.html), and most of their external dependencies. It is designed to help developers easily build scalable web applications, web services, and dynamic web gateways.
