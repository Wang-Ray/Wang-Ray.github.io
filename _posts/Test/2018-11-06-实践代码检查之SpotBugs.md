[SpotBugs](https://spotbugs.github.io/) is a program which uses static analysis to look for bugs in Java code. It is free software, distributed under the terms of the [GNU Lesser General Public License](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html).

SpotBugs is the spiritual successor of [FindBugs](http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/), carrying on from the point where it left off with support of its community. Please check [official manual site](http://spotbugs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for details.

SpotBugs requires JRE (or JDK) 1.8.0 or later to run. However, it can analyze programs compiled for any version of Java, from 1.0 to 1.9.
