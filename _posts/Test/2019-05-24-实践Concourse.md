[Concourse](https://concourse-ci.org/) is an open-source continuous thing-doer.

Built on the simple mechanics of [resources](https://concourse-ci.org/resources.html), [tasks](https://concourse-ci.org/tasks.html), and [jobs](https://concourse-ci.org/jobs.html), Concourse presents a general approach to automation that makes it great for [CI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration)/[CD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery).
