[ab (Apache HTTP server benchmarking tool)](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/programs/ab.html) is a tool for benchmarking your Apache Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) server. It is designed to give you an impression of how your current Apache installation performs. This especially shows you how many requests per second your Apache installation is capable of serving.



## 安装

Debian

```shell
$ sudo apt install apache2-utils
```

RedHat

```shell
$ sudo yum -y install httpd-tools
```
