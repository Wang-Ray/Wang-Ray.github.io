### preauthorizations

`Preauthorizations` are used to request Approval for an `estimated transaction amount` because the final transaction amount will only be known some time later. This type of message is typically sent for transactions such as car rentals, hotel rooms and petrol. The reason for the preauthorization is to authenticate the card and the cardholder and also to check funds availability.

They are similar to the `final authorizations`, but have longer authorize time-frame and allow amount to be extended *(restricted per card brand)*.

### Tokenized e-commerce

E-commerce tokenization is a new way in the payment processing services that provides enhanced safety and convenience for all participants in the process. The technology is based on the replacement of sensitive payment data as PAN to DPAN (or token) and is known as Visa tokenization for Visa and Digital Secure Remote Payments (DSRP) for Mastercard.
