[Kafka Tool](http://www.kafkatool.com/) is a GUI application for managing and using **Apache Kafka** clusters. It provides an intuitive UI that allows one to quickly view objects within a Kafka cluster as well as the messages stored in the topics of the cluster. It contains features geared towards both developers and administrators. Some of the key features include

- Quickly **view all your Kafka clusters**, including their brokers, topics and consumers
- **View contents of messages** in your partitions and add new messages
- **View offsets** of the Kafka consumers, including Apache Storm Kafka spout consumers
- Show **JSON and XML** messages in a pretty-printed format
- **Add and drop topics** plus other management features
- **Save individual messages** from your Kafka partitions to local hard drive
- Write your own [plugins](http://www.kafkatool.com/plugins.html) that allow you to view custom data formats
- Kafka Tool runs on **Windows, Linux and Mac OS**
