[Harbor](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor) is an an open source trusted cloud native registry project that stores, 
signs, and scans content. Harbor extends the open source Docker 
Distribution by adding the functionalities usually required by users 
such as security, identity and management. Having a registry closer to 
the build and run environment can improve the image transfer efficiency.
 Harbor supports replication of images between registries, and also 
offers advanced security features such as user management, access 
control and activity auditing.

基于docker registry基础上扩展了权限控制，审计，镜像同步，管理界面等治理能力。
