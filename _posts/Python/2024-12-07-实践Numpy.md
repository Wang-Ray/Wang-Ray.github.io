[Tornado](http://www.tornadoweb.org/) is a Python web framework and asynchronous networking library, originally developed at [FriendFeed](http://friendfeed.com/). By using non-blocking network I/O, Tornado can scale to tens of thousands of open connections, making it ideal for [long polling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push_technology#Long_polling), [WebSockets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket), and other applications that require a long-lived connection to each user.
