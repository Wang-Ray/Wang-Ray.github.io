[The **same-origin policy**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Defenses/Same-origin_policy) is a critical security mechanism that restricts how a document or script loaded by one [origin](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Origin) can interact with a resource from another origin.

It helps isolate potentially malicious documents, reducing possible attack vectors. For example, it prevents a malicious website on the Internet from running JS in a browser to **read data** from a third-party webmail service (which the user is signed into) or a company intranet (which is protected from direct access by the attacker by not having a public IP address) and relaying that data to the attacker.
