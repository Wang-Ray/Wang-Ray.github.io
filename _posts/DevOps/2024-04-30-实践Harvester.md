[Harvester](https://harvesterhci.io/) is a modern, open, interoperable, [hyperconverged infrastructure (HCI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper-converged_infrastructure) solution built on Kubernetes. It is an open-source alternative designed for operators seeking a [cloud-native](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/cloud-native/) HCI solution. Harvester runs on bare metal servers and provides integrated virtualization and distributed storage capabilities. In addition to traditional virtual machines (VMs), Harvester supports containerized environments automatically through integration with [Rancher](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/integrations-in-rancher/harvester). It offers a solution that unifies legacy virtualized infrastructure while enabling the adoption of containers from core to edge locations.
