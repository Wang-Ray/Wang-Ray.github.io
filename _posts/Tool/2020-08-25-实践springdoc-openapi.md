[springdoc-openapi](https://springdoc.org/) java library helps automating the generation of API documentation using spring boot projects. springdoc-openapi works by examining an application at runtime to infer API semantics based on spring configurations, class structure and various annotations.

Automatically generates documentation in JSON/YAML and HTML format APIs. This documentation can be completed by comments using swagger-api annotations.

This library supports:

- OpenAPI 3
- Spring-boot (v1 and v2)
- JSR-303, specifically for @NotNull, @Min, @Max, and @Size.
- Swagger-ui
- OAuth 2
